<hr>

<h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visit in december 2018</h5>

<p class="text-muted text-left" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

    <p>I loved the movie a lot 
      As I am a great fan of marvel
      Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. 
      The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. 
      Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. 
      Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. 
      I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off.
      The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. 
      Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. 
      The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. 
      This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. 
      The action sequences were jaw-dropping. 
      The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. 
      The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. 
      The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. 
      The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. 
      The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. 
      The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. 
      It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. 
      But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. 
      The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role.
       Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle. The Movie is Incredible.</p>

    <p>Out of all the movies that had ever come out of Disney, "The Lion King" is what I consider to be their greatest achievement of all time. 
      Right as the opening sequence commenced with the "Circle of Life", my heart was so pumped, down to the point where I felt like a kid again every time I saw it. 
      The story was epic on giving an insight of the steps in becoming the next-in-line, the challenges on losing someone dear to them and overcoming their fears, and fighting for what's rightfully theirs. 
      Not only that, but its breathtaking animation really grabs the viewers' experience by showcasing the vast landscapes surrounding Pride Rock as well as all the natural wildlife that settles within. When it comes to the characters, they all had their unique chemistry towards each other and it was really touching to have a father-son relationship spreading throughout most of the movie, which would come in handy for the main character to discover who he really is. While all of this definitely had their moments, the main reason why I consider this as the absolute best to come from Disney would have to be its powerful and emotional score. There were so many colorful and thrilling hits to name, from the dark and mysterious "Be Prepared", "I Just Can't Wait to be King", to the heartfelt and genuine "Can You Feel The Love Tonight", along with the popular "Hakuna Matata". I just can't think of any other Disney film that comes close to being this spectacular. Still to this day, a lot about how this came to be is a mystery, and that's what makes such a timeless masterpiece.</p>
